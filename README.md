## Description

The Purpose of the E-Commerce Me Chainsaw application is to give vendors an easy way to input inventory of an online shop by category and tag to keep an ordedrly storefront online that still looks lovely to the customers eye.

The hardest hurdle for me to get over was routes through the api, especially where to put them and what to call to inside them until I relaized most similar routes like a get and a get are very similar if they are using the same path like a get that uses "/" and another that uses "/" as the path will essentially do the same thing using different models. Which led me down the route of wow how much can I do with gets, puts and posts etc.? Then I wrote most of the backend for our sencond project just due to the motivation and confidence this excercise gave me.
